# YOUR MODULE

## Development

1. [Install devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/)
2. Start a new shell with all tools installed using `devbox shell`
3. Start the module by running `just develop`

## Adding dependencies

If you need additional Services / Tools you can do so.
But you're required to provide them for other developers, too.

We cannot rely on devs to have the required tools in their dev envs.
